    "# Object Designator\n",
    "Object designators are used to describe objects located in the BulletWorld or the real environment and then resolve them during runtime to concrete objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object designators are different from the Object class in bullet_world.py in the way that they just describe an object and do not create objects or provide methods to manipulate them. Nevertheless, object designators contain a reference to the BulletWorld object.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Object designator takes two parameters, of which at least one has to be provided. These parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A list of names \n",
    "   * A list of types \n",
    "   \n",
    "Object Designators work similar to Location designators, they get constrains describing a set of objects and when resolved return a specific instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "For all following examples we need a BulletWorld, so let's create one."

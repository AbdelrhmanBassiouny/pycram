    "\n",
    "Location Designators are used to semantically describe locations in the world. You could, for example, create a location designator that describes every position where a robot can be placed without colliding with the environment. Location designator can describe locations for:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Visibility \n",
    "   * Reachability\n",
    "   * Occupancy \n",
    "   * URDF Links (for example a table)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find locations that fit the given constrains, location designator create Costmaps. Costmaps are a 2D distribution that have a value greater than 0 for every position that fits the costmap criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Location designators work similar to other designators, meaning you have to create a location designator description which describes the location. This description can then be resolved to the actual 6D pose on runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Occupancy\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a simple location designator that describes a location where the robot can be placed without colliding with the environment. To do this we need a BulletWorld since the costmaps are mostly created from the current state of the BulletWorld. "
